/**
 * Turns a visitor's question into a reply, using only the content index.
 *
 * Three paths, in order:
 *
 *   1. Persona — greetings, thanks, goodbyes, names, fun facts, who it is.
 *      Authored lines, in persona.js, and nothing to do with site content.
 *   2. Intent handlers — the questions the chips ask, plus the obvious
 *      neighbours (pricing, contact, booking, location). These get a written
 *      frame around live data rather than a raw result list, because "what
 *      services do you provide?" wants the list of ten, not the three services
 *      that happen to rank highest against those four words.
 *   3. BM25 retrieval over everything else.
 *
 * The frames are the only authored sentences here, and they are deliberately
 * thin — one connective line around content pulled from the index at call time.
 * A frame says "we work across {n} sectors"; it never names the sectors. So
 * adding a thirteenth industry changes the answer without anyone editing this
 * file, which is the same guarantee knowledge.js makes.
 *
 * ── bilingual ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Frames are `{ en, ta }` pairs. The *data* they wrap stays in English,
 * because the site is written in English and machine-translating a service
 * name into Tamil would be inventing copy nobody has approved. So a Tamil
 * answer reads as a Tamil sentence introducing English proper nouns, which is
 * how the language is actually used here.
 *
 * ── purity ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No conversation state lives here. The remembered name and the turn count
 * arrive as arguments and any change to them leaves as `setName`/`clearName`
 * on the reply; the panel owns the conversation. That is what lets the build
 * check answer hundreds of fixtures through the same module without them
 * bleeding into each other.
 *
 * The one exception is `ACTIVE`, the index being read — see its own note for
 * why that is safe and what would break it.
 *
 * ── where the index comes from ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * By default the one webpack froze into the bundle. Pass `ctx.knowledge` to
 * answer from a CMS-built index instead; /api/chat does exactly that.
 *
 * What this cannot do, and does not pretend to: reason. It matches and it
 * quotes. A question whose answer is not written down somewhere on the site
 * gets an honest miss and a route to a human, not an invention.

 * BM25 always returns a ranked list. Nothing in it knows whether the best match

 * question gets whichever page shares an incidental word, and the bot answers
 * "can I drink hot water in winter?" with Manufacturing.
 *
 * Two numbers, because they catch different failures:
 *
 *   SCORE    the match has to be substantive at all.
 *   COVERAGE the match has to explain most of the *question*. This is the one
 *            that stops the hot-water case: five content words went in, one
 *            of them incidentally matched, so coverage is 0.2 and the hit is
 *            refused however hard that single term scored.
 *
 * ANSWER is the bar for stating something as the answer. SUGGEST is the lower
 * bar for offering it as "the closest I found". Below SUGGEST the honest reply
 * is that the question is not ours, and that is what gets sent.
 *
 * These are empirical, and scripts/chat-check.mjs is where they are held
 * honest — it carries must-answer and must-refuse fixtures on both sides of
 * the line. Move a number, run the check.
